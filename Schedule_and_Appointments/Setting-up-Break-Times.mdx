## Introduction

Setting up break times ensures that staff members have designated periods where they are unavailable for bookings. This helps prevent overbooking and ensures that your team has time for rest, meetings, or other non-service-related tasks. By marking break times in the schedule, you can maintain a structured and balanced workflow while improving overall efficiency.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Step 1">
    ## Navigate to Schedule

    Click '[Schedule](https://app.heyallset.com/)' in the side menu to access your calendar view. Here, you can see all upcoming appointments, filter by staff and location, and manage availability in real-time. The schedule allows you to set up and adjust unavailability blocks, ensuring that staff members are only bookable during their working hours.

  <Step title="Step 2">
    ## Create a New Appointment

    Click on an available time slot under the specific staff member who needs a break. Even though this is an "appointment," it will be used to create an unavailability block to prevent bookings during break times. Choosing the correct staff member ensures that their availability is accurately reflected in the system.

  <Step title="Step 3">
    ## Make Appointment Unavailable

    After selecting the time slot, click the 3-dot icon in the appointment window and select “Make Unavailable” from the menu. This action marks the selected time as blocked, preventing customers from booking during this period. The unavailability will now be displayed on the schedule as a blocked-off time slot.

  <Step title="Step 4">
    ## Select Duration for Break Time

    Set the start and end time for the break. Break times must be at least 30 minutes long and cannot exceed 8 hours. If a longer unavailability is needed, consider adjusting staff availability settings instead. Selecting the correct duration ensures the schedule remains structured and prevents scheduling conflicts.

  <Step title="Step 5">
    ## Confirm and Save Break Time

    Double-check the break time details before saving. Once saved, the system will update the schedule, marking the selected time slot as unavailable. Staff members will now have a clearly defined break period, preventing appointments from being scheduled during that time.

## Next Steps

Now that you've set up break times, you can further optimize scheduling by making break times recurring if staff take breaks at the same time daily. Setting up recurring unavailability ensures breaks are automatically blocked off without needing manual adjustments each day. If scheduling changes arise, you can also modify or remove breaks as needed to keep availability flexible. Proper break management helps improve staff efficiency, prevents burnout, and maintains a smooth appointment flow for clients.
