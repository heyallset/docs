## Introduction

Recurring breaks allow staff members to have consistent, pre-scheduled unavailability periods that repeat daily. This prevents the need to manually add break times each day and ensures a structured and predictable schedule. Whether for lunch breaks, team meetings, or other non-service-related activities, setting up recurring breaks helps avoid scheduling conflicts while keeping appointment availability clear for clients.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Step 1">
    ## Select the Break from the Schedule

    Locate the previously created break on the schedule. Click on the blocked-off time slot to open the unavailability settings and proceed with making it a recurring event. Ensuring the break is correctly selected prevents duplicate entries and keeps scheduling consistent.

    ## Make Unavailability Repeating

    Click the 3-dot icon in the unavailability settings and select “Make Repeating” to turn this break time into a recurring event. Recurring breaks automate the process, ensuring the same time is blocked off without needing manual adjustments.

  <Step title="Step 3">
    ## Enter Daily Frequency

    Set the unavailability to repeat daily and choose how often it should recur. You can enter a specific number, such as every 1 day for daily breaks, every 2 days for alternating breaks, or every 3 days for a flexible schedule. Adjusting the frequency ensures that break times match your staff's needs while maintaining a structured calendar.

    ## Confirm and Save Recurring Unavailability

    Review the details to ensure the correct staff member, duration, and recurrence settings are applied. Click "Save" to finalize the recurring break time. Once saved, this break will automatically repeat on the schedule without requiring manual input.

## Next Steps

Now that you've set up recurring breaks, it's time to learn how to create recurring appointments for clients who need ongoing bookings at a set interval. Recurring appointments ensure that clients can maintain a consistent schedule without needing to book manually each time. You can set up weekly recurring appointments for services such as follow-up visits, ongoing treatment sessions, or regular client meetings. Managing both recurring breaks and appointments helps keep your schedule structured and efficient.
