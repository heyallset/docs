## Introduction

Managing appointments efficiently is key to running a smooth booking experience for both your business and customers. With the scheduling system, you can create, modify, and organize appointments quickly. Setting up appointments manually allows for greater control over client bookings, ensuring availability and service selection are properly managed.

  <Step title="Step 1">
    ## Navigate to Schedule

    ## Create a New Appointment

    Click on an available time slot under a specific staff member to create a new appointment. Selecting a time slot directly ensures that the appointment is scheduled within the staff member’s availability. This method helps prevent conflicts and double bookings while allowing you to adjust appointment times based on business needs.

    ## Assign a Client and Service

    Search for an existing client in the system or create a new client profile if they are booking for the first time. Adding a client ensures they receive confirmation and reminder notifications. After selecting the client, choose a service from the available offerings. Services can be assigned to specific staff members, ensuring that the booking reflects accurate availability and expertise.

    ## Confirm and Save Appointment

    Review the appointment details, including the client’s name, selected service, assigned staff, and time. If everything looks correct, click "Create Appointment" to finalize the booking. Once saved, the system will automatically send an email or SMS confirmation to the client, ensuring they have all the necessary details for their appointment.

## Next Steps

Now that you’ve scheduled an appointment, you may need to set up recurring appointments for clients who require ongoing bookings. Setting up recurring appointments allows clients to book on a consistent schedule, such as weekly or biweekly, without needing to rebook each time. Managing both single and recurring appointments effectively ensures a smooth and organized booking experience for your business.
