## Introduction

Recurring appointments allow clients to book services on a consistent schedule without needing to rebook manually each time. This feature is useful for ongoing services such as weekly treatments, coaching sessions, or routine follow-ups. Setting up recurring appointments ensures time slots are reserved in advance, preventing scheduling conflicts and improving customer retention.

    ## Enter Weekly Frequency

    Set the weekly recurrence frequency based on how often the client needs the service. You can select every 1 week for weekly appointments, every 2 weeks for biweekly sessions, or customize the recurrence interval as needed. Choosing the correct frequency ensures that appointments are scheduled consistently without overbooking.

## Next Steps

With recurring appointments set up, it's important to manage availability to avoid scheduling conflicts. To ensure staff members have time for breaks or other non-service-related tasks, you can set up break times to block off unavailable slots. Keeping break times organized alongside recurring appointments helps maintain a balanced and efficient schedule for both staff and clients.
