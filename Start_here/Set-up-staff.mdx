# Set up your staff

## Introduction

Set up your team by adding staff details and connecting them with specific services. Manage individual availability to ensure customers can easily book with the right team member.

## Step 1 - Navigate to Staff

To set up your staff, navigate to 'Business Settings' and click on '[Staff](https://app.heyallset.com/staff)' from the side menu. Here, you can add staff members, assign them to services, and manage their availability.

Invite your staff by sending them an email invitation to create their account. This allows them to set up their profile, manage their availability, and access the system seamlessly.

## Step 3 - Availability & Services

Customize your staff's services and availability by adjusting their service prices and durations. This flexibility allows you to tailor each staff member’s offerings to match their skills and schedule. In the Hours menu, you can set the working hours of each staff member, either repeating or just for a single day. This will instantly update the booking portal, so customers can see when bookings are available, and what days each Staff member is scheduled to work.
