    ## Map Fields 

    After uploading the file, map the imported fields to match the system’s required fields (e.g., First Name, Last Name, Phone). Ensuring that all fields are correctly aligned helps prevent data mismatches.

## Next Steps

Now that you've imported your client data, the next step is configuring business policies to define guidelines for client bookings, payments, and service terms. You can set up review links, consent forms, waivers, booking requirements, and dual pricing to ensure smooth business operations and compliance with your policies.
