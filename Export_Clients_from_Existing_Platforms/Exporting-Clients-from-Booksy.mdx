## Introduction

Unlike other platforms, Booksy does not provide a direct self-service export feature. Instead, you can request your client list by contacting Booksy support through their built-in live chat feature.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Step 1">
    ## Log into Your Booksy Account

    Go to [booksy.com](http://booksy.com) and sign in to your Booksy Biz account on a desktop or laptop.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Step 2">
    ## Open Support Chat

    Click the “?” (Help) icon from the left-hand menu, then select “Support”. This will open a live chat window with Booksy’s support team.

  <Step title="Step 4">
    ## Download the File

    Once the support agent sends your file through the chat, simply click to download it to your computer.
