## Introduction

Consent policies ensure that clients agree to terms, waivers, or specific service conditions before completing a booking. Enabling electronic consent requires customers to check an "I consent" box before their appointment is confirmed, ensuring compliance with the E-Sign Act for legally valid agreements. You can customize consent settings by selecting specific services that require consent and uploading a consent form for client acknowledgment.
