## Introduction

Requesting reviews from clients helps build your business reputation and attract new customers. You can automate review requests by sending a thank-you email 30 minutes after an appointment, prompting clients to leave feedback on Google, Yelp, or any platform of your choice. This feature can be enabled under Marketing Policies in Business Settings.
