## Introduction

Dual Pricing allows businesses to offer two different prices based on the client’s payment method. When enabled, customers paying with cash receive a 4% discount, while those paying by credit card are charged the standard price. This helps businesses offset credit card processing fees while maintaining transparent pricing.
