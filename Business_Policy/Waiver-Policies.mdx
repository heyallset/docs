## Introduction

Waiver policies allow businesses to request customers to complete a waiver before their appointments. Once enabled, an email with instructions will be sent to clients after their first booking. Additionally, you can require a waiver for every booking to ensure compliance. Businesses can upload waiver documents in .PDF or .DOC format for clients to review and sign before confirming their appointment.
