## Introduction

Requiring a credit card at booking helps secure appointments, reduce last-minute cancellations, and ensure a commitment to service. Even if a client chooses to pay in-store, their credit card will be stored for security purposes. Additionally, businesses can allow customers to proceed with their booking even if their credit card can't be validated by enabling the "Allow Cash Payment" option.
