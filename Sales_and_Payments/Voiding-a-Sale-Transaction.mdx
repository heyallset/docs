Voiding a sale transaction allows you to correct errors, process cancellations, or remove incorrect charges from your records. This option is only available for closed clients, meaning the transaction has already been completed. Once voided, the sale will be removed from the active records, ensuring that your financial data remains accurate. Follow these steps to void a sale transaction efficiently.
